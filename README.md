## Introduction
In the world of speed racing, split-second decisions and precise motor is the difference between ecstasy and despair. Fatigue can impair these reaction times, decision-making abilities and concentration of a driver. In addition to the driver, fatigue can also affect pit crews which can affect the timing and execution of pit stops. And not only this, long races and intense schedules can take a toll on the physical and mental well-being of drivers and pit crews which can have a permanent effect on their physical and mental well-being.
The Cognitive Endurance Tracker 01 is a pocket sized robust innovation which makes fatigue monitoring and its management much easier by providing us real-time user's fatigue analysis by providing their key health details in addition with its analysis on the go. It provides important information like the current body temperature, blood pressure, heart-rate, screen/action-time, etc and its output in the form of the user's fatigue level.
## Features
- **Real-time Data Collection**: Gather real-time data on heart rate, body temperature, screen time, activity level, self-reported fatigue, and mood.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict fatigue levels and performance metrics.
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed reports on driver performance and endurance.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data trends and insights through interactive dashboards.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Set up alerts for critical thresholds to ensure prompt interventions.
## Data Collection
The project involves collecting a variety of data points from drivers during training sessions and races. Key metrics include:
- **Heart Rate**: Monitoring heart rate to assess physical exertion.
- **Body Temperature**: Tracking body temperature to detect signs of overheating or fatigue.
- **Screen Time**: Measuring the time spent interacting with the vehicle's displays.
- **Activity Level**: Recording physical activity levels using accelerometers.
- **Self-Reported Fatigue**: Gathering subjective fatigue levels reported by drivers.
- **Mood**: Tracking mood variations to understand mental state.
## Data Processing
Collected data undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and reliability:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing any inconsistencies or missing values.
- **Normalization**: Standardizing data to ensure uniformity.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may help improve model performance.
## Modeling and Analysis
The core of the project involves building predictive models to analyze driver performance and endurance:
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizing algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Providing actionable insights based on model predictions.
## Usage
To use the system, follow these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Ensure that all sensors and data collection devices are properly set up.
2. **Data Processing**: Run preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the data.
3. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the collected data.
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Deploy the system to monitor driver performance in real-time.
5. **Report Generation**: Generate and review reports for insights and recommendations.
